Data Science Bootcamp. The goal here is to apply what I've learnt from the course, the accuracy and robustness of the model dosn't matter here.
Every year thousands of applications are being submitted by international students for admission in colleges of the USA. It becomes an iterative task for the Education Department to know the total number of applications received and then compare that data with the total number of applications successfully accepted and visas processed. Hence to make the entire process easy, the education department in the US analyze the factors that influence the admission of a student into colleges.
